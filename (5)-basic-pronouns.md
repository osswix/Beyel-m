#Pronouns
###Pronouns in beyelım
Pronouns, unlike normal nouns, are more fusional, the root and case tend to merge more together, but after that an array of normal agglutenating suffixes can occur.
Pronouns are not seperated by gender/class in their root forms.
###Pronoun roots

          | usage  | Nominative | Accusative | Topic
----------|--------|------------|------------|-------
1st person|Plain   | Na         | Nano       | Nan
          |'Cute'  | A          | Aon        | Aya
2nd person|Plain   | Ngih       | Ngöhn      | Ngah
          |Familiar| An         | Anon       | Ana
3rd person|Plain   | I          | Ion        | Iya

The roots of the second person are front harmony while all other roots (the 1st and 3rd person ones) are back harmony.

###Suffixes

There are three layers of suffies that can be added after the fusional rootforms. The first layer is mostly gender, the second layer is number and the third layer is relation.

###Genders

Class | Suffix (front harmony) | Suffix (back harmony)
------|------------------------|-----------------------
Male  | më                     | me
Female| in                     | ın
Animal| öhë                    | ohe
Family| a                      | a

###Number

Number | Suffix (front harmony) | Suffix (back harmony)
-------|------------------------|-----------------------
Dual   | të                     | te
Paucal | ngë                    | nge
Plural | zë                     | ze

###Relation

Relation | Suffix (front harmony) | Suffix (back harmony)
---------|------------------------|-----------------------
formal   | im                     | ım
familiar | an                     | an
humble   | ö                      | o
informal | ëjë                    | eje

The first vowel of the relation suffix can replace the ë/e from the number suffix. so a 3st person nominative dual formal looks like "Itım" insted of "Iteım".
