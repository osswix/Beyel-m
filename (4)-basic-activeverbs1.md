#Basic active verbs
###Verbs in beyelım
Verbs don't conjugate to person or number. They do conjugate to aspect, tense, modality and voice. Even though the verbs do not conjugate to person, beyelım is pronoun dropping, if a pronoun (or any other part of a sentence) is obvious from context, it is left out.

###Voice
Voice is an important part of the beyelım verbs. The voice can either be active, reflexive and passive. Only the active voice will be explained in the basic grammar.

###Aspect
Verbs can conjugate to a number of aspects, the most important ones being the gnomic, habitual, initiative, perfect and simple.

Aspect | suffix (front harmony) | suffix (back harmony) | example (*miki-* drink)(front harmony)| example (*mbayırı-* kick)(back harmony) 
-------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------
simple | -                      | -                     | miki                                  | mbayırı
perfect| rë                     | re                    | mikirë                                | mbayıre
gnomic | nën                    | nen                   | mikinën                               | mbayırınen

!NB if the final syllable of the verb root starts with the same consonant as the suffix, that syllable is replaced with the suffix.

###Tense
Instead of tense, aspect is more a more important and direct way of telling someone when something happened, tense is used to indicate a very far past, or a prediction of the future. Common tenses are the present, the archaic tense (also known as far past), and (far) future, including probability in both the archaic and (far) future tenses.
the suffix of tense comes after the aspect suffix.

future            | ma                     | ma                    | mikama                                | mbayırıma
improbable future | möyën                  | moyen                 | mikamöyën                             | mbayırımoyen
