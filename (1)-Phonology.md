###allophony rules
<sup>1</sup> Nasal consonants turn into prenesalized voiced stops word initially, /m/, /n/ and /ŋ/ turn into [ᵐb], [ⁿd] and [ᵑg]

<sup>2</sup> Unvoiced consonants become voiced if not word initially. /p/, /t/, /k/, /ɸ/, /ʂ/, /tɕ/ and /ʈʂ/ turn into [b], [d], [g], [β], [ʐ], [dʑ] and [ɖʐ]

<sup>3</sup> /s/ turns into [ts] before /i/ or /ɯ/. /s/ turns into [z] if not word initially and into [dz] if not word initially and before /i/ or /ɯ/.

<sup>4</sup> /x/ may be pronounced as any fricative from palatal to glottal, though tends to be (more) palattal before /i/ and /ɯ/, this differs per speaker.

<sup>5</sup> /l/ is pronounced as [n] word initially.

<sup>6</sup> /ʀ/ is pronounced as [ɾ] or [ɽ] intervocally.

##Vowels

###Phonemes

       | Front | Center | Back |
-------|-------|--------|------|
High   | i     |        | ɯ    |
Low-mid| ɛ     | ɵ      | ʌ ɔ  |
Low    |       |        | ɑ    |

###Harmony

Front|Back|
-----|----|
 i   | ɯ  |
 ɛ   | ʌ  |
 ɵ   | ɔ  |

/ɑ/ is considered a neutral vowel, but might be realized slightly fronted (center) as [ä] in front-harmony words.
 
####Diphthongs
Normally a hiatus is inserted between any two vowels, except if an /i/ or /ɯ/ vowel proceeds any vowel other than /i/ or /ɯ/. In that case a dipthong forms with an /i/ or /ɯ/ as latter part of the dipthong.

##Tones
<table>
<tr><td>High tone</td><td>˥</td></tr>
<tr><td>Middle tone</td><td>˧</td></tr>
<tr><td>Low tone</td><td>˩</td></tr>
</table>
###Tone sandhi
Tones tend to contour towards the proceeding tone, so /ji˥.tsi˩/ becomes /ji˥˩.tsi˩/, the first part of the tone always remains the same hight as it would be when it would be a flat tone, but the tone ends where the proceeding tone starts.
This effect does extend beyond word boundries except if the proceeding word starts with a vowel.

##Phonotactics
###Syllables
A syllable can be (C)V or N, where C is any consonant, V is any vowel and N is any nasal consonant.
###Timing
The ideal timing is syllable timing, where each syllable is pronounced as long as any other syllable, however in realistic speech a syllabic nasal is slightly shorter than a full CV syllable. A V syllable however is always as long as a CV syllable.
###Stress
The stress always is on the initial syllable, with syllabic nasal syllables excluded, if a word sounds on a nasal syllable the first proceeding (C)V syllable gets stressed.
