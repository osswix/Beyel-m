Nominative | Subject of a sentence        | **I** kicked the dog.          | TBD
Accusative | Direct object of a sentence  | I kicked **the dog**.          | TBD

Name       | Suffix (front harmony) | Suffix (back harmony) | Example (*ödzin-* plant) (front harmony) | Example (*ndını-* dog) (back harmony)
-----------|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------
Nominative | -                      | -                     | ödzin                                    | ndını
Accusative | -(n)ön                 | -(n)on                | ödzin**ön**                              | ndını**non**
Topic      | -(n)a                  | -(n)a                 | ödzin**a**                               | ndını**a**

If a noun-root doesn't end on a nasal syllable, the (n) part of the suffix appears, else the nasal syllable will merge with the vowel syllable and form a CV syllable.
